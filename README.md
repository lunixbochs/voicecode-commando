voicecode command cheat sheet

To get this working, clone the repository to somewhere under your `~/voicecode directory`.

You will need to be running the python server, which does the heavy lifting, in order for your commands to be populated.

The only python requirement is flask.

Assuming you have `pip` available, the following commands will get the python application running in your terminal:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py

If the python server is not running, the window that pops up when you use the ðŸ”‰commandoðŸ”‰ command will just be a completely blank screen.
